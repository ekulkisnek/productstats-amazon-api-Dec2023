<p>Unlike many other brands&#x27; kitchenettes, all Summit units include a refrigerator with a freezer compartment to cover all of your cold storage needs. The ACK72ELSTW includes the CT661W, with 5.1 cu.ft. of storage space. A dual evaporator system separately cools the auto defrost refrigerator section and manual defrost freezer compartment for improved overall performance. This model includes adjustable glass shelves, door storage, a scalloped wine shelf, and crisper. The ACK72ELSTW also ships with Summit REX2421WRT, a 24&quot; wide 220V electric range complete with a smooth-top 4-element cooking surface and a full oven compartment with a bake and broil function. This range includes a large window with interior oven light, adjustable slide-out oven racks, hot surface indicator lights for added safety, and a pull-out drawer for storage as needed. The range can be installed on the left or right side of the kitchenette.</p>

All you need to do is measure each deck/stair side and order a kit that most closely match in length (always round up to the nearest size to ensure proper fit as kits can be trimmed down to your exact length).  All kits come with posts that are pre-drilled, mounting bolts, CityPost patented top rail bracket, all cable and cable hardware is marine grade 316 stainless steel (10 percent extra cable is included with every order). In addition, all kits come with metal top rail that is powder coated to match the posts. 100 percent of components are included to complete your railing. [Example] For a deck with three sides that measure [12FT, 24FT,12FT] you will want to order three CityPost kits: (2) 12FT kits and (1) 24FT kit. For any corners/changes in direction simply add CityPost top rail sleeves to your order to conceal any top rail corner joints. For LOWES ordering questions, please reach out to CityPost at 855-get-city to speak to an ordering expert.  We will be happy to walk you through the process. Note, swaging tool and cable cutter not included. Not recommended withing 3 miles of salt water (order stainless steel post option in that case).</p>
